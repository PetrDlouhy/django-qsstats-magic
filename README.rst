django-qsstats-magic: QuerySet statistics for Django
====================================================

The goal of django-qsstats is to be a microframework to make
repetitive tasks such as generating aggregate statistics of querysets
over time easier.  It's probably overkill for the task at hand, but yay
microframeworks!

django-qsstats-magic is a refactoring of django-qsstats app with slightly
changed API, simplified internals and faster time_series implementation.


Requirements
============

* `python-dateutil <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_ > 1.4, < 2.0
* `django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ 1.8+

Database
--------

If timezone support is enabled in Django, the database must have also timezone support installed.
For MySQL it might be needed to run:

::
  - mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql

Examples
========

How many users signed up today? this month? this year?
------------------------------------------------------

::

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    import qsstats

    qs = User.objects.all()
    qss = qsstats.QuerySetStats(qs, 'date_joined')

    print '%s new accounts today.' % qss.this_day()
    print '%s new accounts this week.' % qss.this_week()
    print '%s new accounts this month.' % qss.this_month()
    print '%s new accounts this year.' % qss.this_year()
    print '%s new accounts until now.' % qss.until_now()

This might print something like::

    5 new accounts today.
    11 new accounts this week.
    27 new accounts this month.
    377 new accounts this year.
    409 new accounts until now.

Aggregating time-series data suitable for graphing
--------------------------------------------------

::

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    import datetime, qsstats

    qs = User.objects.all()
    qss = qsstats.QuerySetStats(qs, 'date_joined')

    today = datetime.date.today()
    seven_days_ago = today - datetime.timedelta(days=7)

    time_series = qss.time_series(seven_days_ago, today)
    print 'New users in the last 7 days: %s' % [t[1] for t in time_series]

This might print something like::

    New users in the last 7 days: [3, 10, 7, 4, 12, 9, 11]


Please see qsstats/tests.py for similar usage examples.

API
===

The ``QuerySetStats`` object
----------------------------

In order to provide maximum flexibility, the ``QuerySetStats`` object
can be instantiated with as little or as much information as you like.
All keword arguments are optional but ``DateFieldMissing`` and
``QuerySetMissing`` will be raised if you try to use ``QuerySetStats``
without providing enough information.

``qs``
    The queryset to operate on.

    Default: ``None``

``date_field``
    The date field within the queryset to use.

    Default: ``None``

``aggregate``
    The django aggregation instance. Can be set also set when
    instantiating or calling one of the methods.

    Default: ``Count('id')``

``operator``
    The default operator to use for the ``pivot`` function.  Can be also set
    when calling ``pivot``.

    Default: ``'lte'``

``today``
    The date that will be considered as today date. If ``today`` param is None
    QuerySetStats' today will be datetime.date.today().

    Default: ``None``


All of the documented methods take a standard set of keyword arguments
that override any information already stored within the ``QuerySetStats``
object.  These keyword arguments are ``date_field`` and ``aggregate``.

Once you have a ``QuerySetStats`` object instantiated, you can receive a
single aggregate result by using the following methods:

* ``for_minute``
* ``for_hour``
* ``for_day``
* ``for_week``
* ``for_month``
* ``for_year``

    Positional arguments: ``dt``, a ``datetime.datetime`` or ``datetime.date``
    object to filter the queryset to this interval (minute, hour, day, week,
    month or year).

* ``this_minute``
* ``this_hour``
* ``this_day``
* ``this_week``
* ``this_month``
* ``this_year``

    Wrappers around ``for_<interval>`` that uses ``dateutil.relativedelta`` to
    provide aggregate information for this current interval.

``QuerySetStats`` also provides a method for returning aggregated
time-series data which may be extremely using in plotting data:

``time_series``
    Positional arguments: ``start`` and ``end``, each a
    ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime`` object used in marking
    the start and stop of the time series data.

    Keyword arguments: In addition to the standard ``date_field`` and
    ``aggregate`` keyword argument, ``time_series`` takes an optional
    ``interval`` keyword argument used to mark which interval to use while
    calculating aggregate data between ``start`` and ``end``.  This argument
    defaults to ``'days'`` and can accept ``'years'``, ``'months'``,
    ``'weeks'``, ``'days'``, ``'hours'`` or ``'minutes'``.
    It will raise ``InvalidInterval`` otherwise.

    This methods returns a list of tuples.  The first item in each
    tuple is a ``datetime.datetime`` object for the current inverval.  The
    second item is the result of the aggregate operation.  For
    example::

        [(datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 28, 0, 0), 12), (datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 29, 0, 0), 0), ...]

    Formatting of date information is left as an exercise to the user and may
    vary depending on interval used.

``until``
    Provide aggregate information until a given date or time, filtering the
    queryset using ``lte``.

    Positional arguments: ``dt`` a ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime``
    object to be used for filtering the queryset since.

    Keyword arguments: ``date_field``, ``aggregate``.

``until_now``
    Aggregate information until now.

    Positional arguments: ``dt`` a ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime``
    object to be used for filtering the queryset since (using ``lte``).

    Keyword arguments: ``date_field``, ``aggregate``.

``after``
    Aggregate information after a given date or time, filtering the queryset
    using ``gte``.

    Positional arguments: ``dt`` a ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime``
    object to be used for filtering the queryset since.

    Keyword arguments: ``date_field``, ``aggregate``.

``after_now``
    Aggregate information after now.

    Positional arguments: ``dt`` a ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime``
    object to be used for filtering the queryset since (using ``gte``).

    Keyword arguments: ``date_field``, ``aggregate``.

``pivot``
    Used by ``since``, ``after``, and ``until_now`` but potentially useful if
    you would like to specify your own operator instead of the defaults.

    Positional arguments: ``dt`` a ``datetime.date`` or ``datetime.datetime``
    object to be used for filtering the queryset since (using ``lte``).

    Keyword arguments: ``operator``, ``date_field``, ``aggregate``.

    Raises ``InvalidOperator`` if the operator provided is not one of ``'lt'``,
    ``'lte'``, ``gt`` or ``gte``.

Testing
=======

If you'd like to test ``django-qsstats-magic`` against your local configuration, add
``qsstats`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and run ``./manage.py test qsstats``.
The test suite assumes that ``django.contrib.auth`` is installed.

For testing against different python, DB and django versions install tox
(pip install tox) and run 'tox' from the source checkout::

    $ tox

Db user 'qsstats_test' with password 'qsstats_test' and a DB 'qsstats_test'
should exist.

Difference from django-qsstats
==============================

1. Faster time_series method using 1 sql query (currently works for MySQL and
   PostgreSQL, with a fallback to the old method for other DB backends).
2. Single ``aggregate`` parameter instead of ``aggregate_field`` and
   ``aggregate_class``. Default value is always ``Count('id')`` and can't be
   specified in settings.py. ``QUERYSETSTATS_DEFAULT_OPERATOR`` option is also
   unsupported now.
3. Support for minute and hour aggregates.
4. ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` arguments are renamed to ``start`` and
   ``end`` because of 3.
5. Internals are changed.

I don't know if original author (Matt Croydon) would like my changes so
I renamed a project for now. If the changes will be merged then
django-qsstats-magic will become obsolete.
